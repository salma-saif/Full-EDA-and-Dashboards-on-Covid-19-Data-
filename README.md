🌍 COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

This project explores and visualizes the global spread of COVID-19 using Python for data analysis and Power BI for interactive dashboards.

🔎 Project Overview

Performed data cleaning & preprocessing in Python.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends:

Global & regional cases over time

Country-level comparisons

Monthly/weekly trends

Created interactive visualizations using Plotly (e.g., choropleth world maps of cumulative cases).

Built Power BI dashboards for business-style insights and storytelling.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Power BI: Interactive dashboards & reporting

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for analysis

📊 Key Insights

Evolution of COVID-19 cases globally and regionally.

Country-level differences in cumulative cases.

Visual storytelling through maps and dashboards.
